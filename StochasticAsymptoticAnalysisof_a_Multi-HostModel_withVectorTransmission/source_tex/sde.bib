  Abstract                 = {As part of a World Health Organization-led effort to update the empirical evidence base for the leishmaniases, national experts provided leishmaniasis case data for the last 5 years and information regarding treatment and control in their respective countries and a comprehensive literature review was conducted covering publications on leishmaniasis in 98 countries and three territories (see ‘Leishmaniasis Country Profiles Text S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S24, S25, S26, S27, S28, S29, S30, S31, S32, S33, S34, S35, S36, S37, S38, S39, S40, S41, S42, S43, S44, S45, S46, S47, S48, S49, S50, S51, S52, S53, S54, S55, S56, S57, S58, S59, S60, S61, S62, S63, S64, S65, S66, S67, S68, S69, S70, S71, S72, S73, S74, S75, S76, S77, S78, S79, S80, S81, S82, S83, S84, S85, S86, S87, S88, S89, S90, S91, S92, S93, S94, S95, S96, S97, S98, S99, S100, S101’). Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.},

  Abstract                 = {Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. The main mode of transmission of this disease in endemic areas is through an insect vector called triatomine bug. Triatomines become infected with T. cruzi by feeding blood of an infected person or animal. Chagas disease is considered the most important vector borne infection in Latin America. It is estimated that between 16 and 18 millions of persons are infected with T. cruzi, and at least 20,000 deaths each year. In this work we formulate a model for the transmission of this infection among humans, vectors and domestic mammals. Our main objective is to assess the effectiveness of Chagas disease control measures. For this, we do sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R 0 and the endemic proportions with respect to epidemiological and demographic parameters. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, we develop a new numerical method with asymptotic stability properties for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The foundations for the new solver are the Steklov mean and an exact discretization for the deterministic version of the SDEs. Strong consistency and convergence properties are demonstrated for the proposed method. Moreover, a rigorous linear and nonlinear asymptotic stability analysis is carried out for the multiplicative case in a mean-square sense and for the additive case in a path-wise sense using the pullback limit. In order to emphasize the characteristics of the Steklov discretization we use as benchmarks the stochastic logistic equation and the Langevin equation with a nonlinear potential of the Brownian dynamics. We show that the Steklov method has mild stability requirements and allows long-time simulations in several applications. },
