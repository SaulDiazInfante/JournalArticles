	We present a stochastic extension of a disease vector transmission model with 
multi-hosts. Our deterministic dynamics considers vectors and his interacting 
with two kind of hosts. Applying a general stochastic perturbation 
to a vector biting rate, we extend to a stochastic differential 
equation system (SDEs), which model the influence of environmental noise on the 
vector transmission.
