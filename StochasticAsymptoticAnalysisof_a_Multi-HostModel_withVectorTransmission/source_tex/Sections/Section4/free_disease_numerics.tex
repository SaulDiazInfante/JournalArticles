	Under context of \Cref{theo:GSAS}, we use some parameter values from 
literature (see \Cref{tbl:free_disease_parameters}) and tune the rest
parameters in order to satisfies our conditions of global stochastic asymptotic
stability. Thus, we consider a whole human density of $H=\num{1500}$ habitants
which sustain $A=\num{2500}$ domestic animals. The maximum allowable number of 
vectors is assumed $20$ times host population $H$.  Likewise, we assume a
human and animals lifetime of $70$ and $6$ years, respectively, which yields
the mortalities rates 
$\mu_{h} = \num{0.0142857}\ \si{year^{-1}}$ and 
$\mu_{a} = \num{0.1666666}\ \si{year^{-1}}$. 
The vector mortality is $\mu_{v}= \num{281.1}~\si{year^{-1}}$.

	In \Cref{fig:trajectories_free_desease} we contras the effect of noise
between infected population of humans and vectors. Remember that we perturb
bitting parameters, so is feasible to obtain a most notable effect over this
population. However, as \Cref{theo:GSAS} states, we recover the extinction of
disease. We confirm these observation with the mean and variance estimation. As
we see in \Cref{fig:mean_free_disease}, the expected value of the stochastic
solution practically follows our deterministic dynamics, for this reason we get
low numerical variance at long time ---~see \Cref{fig:variance_free_disease}.
We generate \num{10 000} trajectories to estimate the mean and variance
of the infected populations. In addition, we register the first time when each 
one of this realizations achieves a level less than one individual for all 
infected populations. \Cref{fig:extinction_stopping_time_histograms} shows how
the \num{10 000} concentrates between \num{220} and \num{230} \si{years} --- 
this suggest that Chagas extinguishes (with high probability) after \num{250}
years.
