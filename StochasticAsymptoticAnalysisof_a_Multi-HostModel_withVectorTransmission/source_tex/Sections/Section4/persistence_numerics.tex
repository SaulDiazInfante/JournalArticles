	Now we illustrate that Chagas survive under hypothesis of 
	\Cref{theo:persist}. For guarantee these conditions, we use the 
	paramters 
	values  of \Cref{tbl:persistence_parameters}. 
	Here, we chose the step size 
	and initial conditions from \Cref{tbl:initial_conditions}.
	In \Cref{fig:persistence_path}, we show  a sample path solution of 
	SDE \eqref{eq.8}, as we see, our stochastic extension similarly 
	follows the deterministic dynamics of \eqref{eq.1}. To confirm this claim, 
	we generate \num{10 000} trajectories to estimate statistic of the 
	solution process to SDE \eqref{eq.8}. 
	\Cref{fig:mean_persistence} shows the mean value. The histograms of 
	\Cref{fig:persistence_histograms} suggest that almost all individuals became
	infected. Finally in \Cref{fig:noise_variance_reduction} we show how
	conforming decrease the variance solutions 
	respect to the noise intensities 
	$\eta_i:=(\sigma_{z_h}^i ,\sigma_{z_a}^i)$.
